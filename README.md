# Rook
Rook is a simple language that compiles to WebAssembly.

I made rook to have something expressive but simple to write Kona with. There are a lot of languages that compile to WebAssembly, and each one abstracts operations and structures in an unpredictable way. A few are really great. But not one is purpose built just for WebAssembly. It's my effort that Rook will look like it could be S Expressions, but much easier; Provide some predictable builtins for working with bits and bytes, structs and enums; And have predictable and very small compilation outputs.

The first Version is based off of the Wafer compiler made in the [WebAssembly from the Ground Up](https://wasmgroundup.com) book. But it's gettin' hefty.
