# Rook
Rook is a simple language that compiles to WebAssembly.

I made rook to have something expressive but simple to write Kona with. There are a lot of languages that compile to WebAssembly, and each one abstracts operations and structures in an unpredictable way. It's my effort that Rook will look like it could be S Expressions, but much easier. Also provide some predictable builtins for working with bits and bytes, structs and enums.

First Version is based off of the Wafer compiler made in the [WebAssembly from the Ground Up](https://wasmgroundup.com) book.
